When we sleep through dawn, we miss more than just sunrise—we miss the clarity, energy, and fresh perspective that each new day offers.

Dawn reminds us that no matter what happened yesterday, today is a new chance to start fresh, see clearly, and live fully.",

Notice how starting your day consciously (instead of rushing) changes your whole day's energy. Like Tara discovered, those who greet the dawn with awareness truly live more fully."
