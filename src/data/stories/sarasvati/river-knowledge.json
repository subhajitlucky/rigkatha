In discussing ideas, we discover connections we never saw alone. But when we dam up knowledge, refusing to share it, it stagnates within us—just like blocked water.

More than that—her own understanding deepened. Teaching others made her realize connections she'd never seen before. Explaining concepts helped her understand them more clearly. And new knowledge seemed to flow to her effortlessly. By becoming a river instead of a dam, she'd tapped into the infinite source of Sarasvati herself. She learned that you can never lose knowledge by giving it away—you can only multiply it.",

    "title": "Knowledge Multiplies When Shared",
    "content": "Sarasvati teaches us that knowledge is fundamentally different from material possessions. If you give away your money, you have less. But if you give away your knowledge, you actually have MORE—because teaching deepens understanding, sharing creates discussion that sparks new insights, and generosity with learning attracts more learning opportunities. Knowledge is like a river: it must flow to stay fresh. When we receive knowledge from teachers and share it with others, we become channels for an infinite source. When we hoard knowledge, it stagnates and dies within us. The paradox is beautiful: the more freely you give knowledge, the more knowledge flows to you.",
    "practicalApplication": "This week, practice being a knowledge river: Share something you know with someone who wants to learn—teach a skill, explain a concept, recommend a book. Notice how teaching clarifies your own understanding. Join or start a study group where everyone shares insights. When you learn something interesting, don't keep it to yourself—tell someone! Create a blog, make a video, or simply have conversations. Keep a 'flow journal'—write what you learned (received) and what you taught (shared) each day. Like Sarasvati's river, aim to be both receiving upstream and giving downstream. Remember: hoarding knowledge doesn't make you powerful—channeling it does!"

    "question": "Why were Vidya's books decaying even though she kept them carefully?",
    "options": [
      "The library had poor ventilation and moisture damage",
      "Someone was secretly damaging them out of jealousy",
      "Knowledge dies when it stops flowing—when it's hoarded instead of shared",
      "The books were very old and naturally deteriorating"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 2,
    "explanation": "Vidya's books were decaying because knowledge itself was dying within her due to lack of flow. Like water that becomes stagnant when blocked from flowing, knowledge deteriorates when hoarded and not shared. Sarasvati showed Vidya that knowledge must flow—received from teachers and passed on to students—to stay alive and fresh. When Vidya transformed into a teacher who shared freely, her books stopped decaying because the knowledge was flowing again. This teaches us that knowledge is not meant to be possessed but to be channeled."
