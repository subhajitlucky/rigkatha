His body grew stronger because Nasatya's medicines had something to work with: a will to live that Dasra had rekindled. Within weeks, the king was restored—healthier than he'd been in years. The cure wasn't medicine alone, nor compassion alone. It was both, perfectly balanced.",

  "lesson": {
    "title": "The Balance of Science and Compassion",
    "content": "The Ashvins teach us that the most powerful solutions often require balancing complementary approaches. In healing, we need both the science of medicine and the art of compassion. In teaching, we need both knowledge and patience. In leadership, we need both strength and kindness. Often, we encounter problems where we think 'it's either A or B,' but the truth is 'it's both A and B together.' Like the Ashvins, we become most effective when we combine seemingly opposite qualities into one complete approach.",
    "practicalApplication": "This week, look for areas where you're relying on only one approach: Are you studying hard (like Nasatya) but forgetting to take care of your mental health (like Dasra)? Are you being kind to friends (like Dasra) but not holding them accountable when needed (like Nasatya)? Are you pursuing excellence in skills but neglecting relationships, or vice versa? Try to find the balance. Ask yourself: 'What's the complementary quality I'm missing?' Remember, the Ashvins are powerful not because they're the same, but because they're perfectly complementary twins!"

    "question": "Why did the king remain sick even after receiving perfect medicine from Nasatya?",
    "options": [
      "The medicine was incorrectly prepared",
      "The king was pretending to be sick",
      "His grief and loss of will to live prevented his body from healing",
      "He needed a different type of medicine"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 2,
    "explanation": "The king remained sick because his grief over losing his son had caused him to lose his will to live. Even though Nasatya's medicine was perfectly prepared and technically correct, the body cannot heal properly when the spirit has given up. Dasra's compassion helped rekindle the king's will to live, which then allowed Nasatya's medicine to work effectively. This shows that true healing often requires addressing both physical and emotional needs together."
