And that day, the little cloud realized that asking for help and working together isn't weakness—it's wisdom.",

    "content": "The Maruts teach us that unity multiplies strength. When we try to do everything alone, we struggle and often fail. But when we work together with others who share our goals, we can accomplish what seems impossible. The key is true unity—not just being in the same place, but moving with the same purpose, supporting each other, and celebrating each other's contributions. In unity, 1+1 doesn't equal 2... it equals 10, or 100, or 1000!",
    "practicalApplication": "This week, look for chances to unite with others: In school projects, don't try to do everything yourself—contribute your part while appreciating others' contributions. In sports or games, focus on the team's success rather than your individual glory. At home, coordinate with siblings or parents to accomplish tasks together. Notice how things that seem hard alone become easy when everyone works as one. Remember: a single stick breaks easily, but a bundle of sticks is nearly unbreakable!"

      "Each Marut is individually very strong",
      "They have magical lightning weapons",
      "They all move together with one purpose and one heart",
      "They are bigger than other storm clouds"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 2,
    "explanation": "The Maruts' true power comes from their perfect unity. Though there are forty-nine of them, they move as one being, with one purpose and one heart. Individually, each Marut is not much bigger or stronger than the little cloud, but together they become an unstoppable storm. This teaches us that cooperation and unity can multiply our strength far beyond what any individual could achieve alone."
