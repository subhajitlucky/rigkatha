    "title": "Courage to Face Darkness",
    "content": "Indra's battle with Vritra teaches us that sometimes we must face our fears and fight for what is right, even when the challenge seems impossible. Vritra represents any obstacle that holds back the flow of good things in life—whether it's fear, selfishness, or injustice. Like Indra, we must have the courage to stand up against these forces, not just for ourselves, but for the wellbeing of everyone around us.",
    "practicalApplication": "When you see something wrong—bullying, waste, or unfairness—don't stay silent. Speak up with courage. Even small acts of bravery, like standing up for a friend or protecting nature, are your own battles against 'Vritra.' Remember: true heroes fight not for glory, but to help others."

      "To become famous and powerful",
