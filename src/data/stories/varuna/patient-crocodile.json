  "lesson": {
    "title": "The Power of Patience and Truth",
    "content": "This story teaches two essential lessons: First, that patience is not about doing nothing—it's about trusting the natural order and timing of things. Just as a seed becomes a tree in its own time, good things come to those who work steadily without impatience. Second, truth is the foundation of character. While lies might seem easier in the moment, they create burdens that weigh on our hearts. Speaking truth, even when difficult, sets us free and honors the cosmic law (Rita) that Varuna guards.",
    "practicalApplication": "When you're impatient for results—whether in studies, friendships, or goals—remember the prince and the crocodile. Work steadily and trust the process. When tempted to lie to avoid consequences, remember that truth always surfaces eventually. Choose the courage of honesty over the temporary ease of lies. Your integrity is your most valuable treasure."

    "question": "What are the two main lessons the crocodile taught Prince Arun?",
    "options": [
      "To swim well and catch fish",
      "To be patient and speak truth",
      "To fear crocodiles and rivers",
      "To become king and rule wisely"

    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "The ancient crocodile, guardian of Varuna, taught Prince Arun two vital lessons: patience (understanding that things happen in their proper time according to cosmic law) and truthfulness (that lies create burdens while truth sets us free). These lessons transformed the impatient, dishonest prince into a wise, truthful person."
