But he had developed a rigid belief: that strength meant being fierce, hard, and unyielding at all times. When he saw others showing gentleness or compassion, he considered them weak. When anyone suggested rest or mercy, he scoffed. In his mind, a true warrior was like an unbreakable sword—always hard, always sharp, never bending.",

He collapsed deep in the forest, alone, unable to walk, his rigid pride now a prison that kept him from calling for help.",

I am both—and that is real power.'",

    "title": "True Strength: The Wisdom of Balance",
    "content": "Rudra teaches us that authentic strength is not about being fierce all the time or gentle all the time—it's about having both capacities and the wisdom to choose appropriately. Like Rudra who is both the destroying storm and the healing physician, we can be both strong and tender, both fierce and compassionate. The truly strong person can speak firmly when boundaries are needed, yet listen gently when someone needs understanding. They can push themselves hard when growth requires it, yet rest without shame when rest is needed. This balance—this choice—is far more powerful than rigid one-sidedness.",
    "practicalApplication": "This week, practice Rudra's balance: If you tend to be 'fierce' (direct, intense, pushing), practice moments of intentional gentleness—listen without fixing, rest without guilt, show vulnerability. If you tend to be 'gentle' (accommodating, soft-spoken, avoiding conflict), practice moments of healthy fierceness—set a boundary, speak a hard truth kindly, push yourself beyond comfort in growth. Journal about which is harder for you. Remember: it takes more strength to choose appropriately than to be stuck in one mode!"

      "Always be as fierce and hard as possible",
      "Never show any emotion or vulnerability",
      "True strength is knowing when to be fierce and when to be gentle",

    ],
    "correctAnswer": 2,
    "explanation": "Rudra teaches that true strength is not about being fierce all the time or gentle all the time, but about having the wisdom to choose the right response for each situation. Like Rudra who is both the destroying storm and the healing physician, real strength means having both capacities and knowing when to use each. Someone who can only be fierce or only be gentle is actually limited. True power comes from balance and wise choice."
