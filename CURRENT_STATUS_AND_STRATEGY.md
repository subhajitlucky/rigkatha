## 📊 REALISTIC ASSESSMENT

### **The Challenge:**

- Each needs 1.5-3 hours of careful work
- Requires Sanskrit scholarship
- ~285-570 hours total for Mandala 1 alone

### **The Reality:**
**You CANNOT implement all 190 hymns in one session.**

Why?
- Requires accurate Sanskrit from reliable sources
- Need proper translation verification  
- Sacred texts deserve careful treatment
- Quality > Speed

---

## 🎯 RECOMMENDED STRATEGY

### **Phase 1: Foundation (Hymns 1-10)** ⏳ IN PROGRESS
✅ Hymn 1 - DONE
✅ Hymn 2 - DONE
⏳ Hymns 3-10 - NEXT (same composer, foundational)

**Timeline:** 2-3 weeks (2-3 hymns/week)

### **Phase 2: Famous Hymns (Top 20)** 📋 PLANNED
Select most important/studied hymns:
- Hymn 1.32 (Indra vs Vritra)
- Hymn 1.154 (Vishnu)
- Hymn 3.62 (Gayatri Mantra)
- Hymn 10.90 (Purusha Sukta)
- Hymn 10.129 (Nasadiya Sukta)
- etc.

**Timeline:** 1-2 months

### **Phase 3: Complete Mandala 1** 🎯 LONG TERM
Fill in remaining hymns systematically

**Timeline:** 3-4 months
