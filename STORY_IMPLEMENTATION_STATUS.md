- Lessons should have practical modern applications
- Quiz should test comprehension, not trivia

### Image Generation Tips
- Use consistent character designs across panels
- Maintain warm, spiritual color palette
- Reference traditional Indian art but keep it modern
- Each scene should be clear and uncluttered
