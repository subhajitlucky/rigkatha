## ✅ What We Did

### 1. **Moved & Renamed All Images**
```bash
FROM: public/agni-wise-fish-panel-1.jpg
TO:   public/stories/agni/wise-fish/panel-1.jpg

FROM: public/agni-wise-fish-panel-2.jpg.jpeg
TO:   public/stories/agni/wise-fish/panel-2.jpg

FROM: public/agni-wise-fish-panel-3.jpeg.jpeg
TO:   public/stories/agni/wise-fish/panel-3.jpg

... and so on for all 6 panels
```

### 2. **Standardized File Extensions**
- All images now consistently end in `.jpg`
- No more double extensions (`.jpg.jpeg` or `.jpeg.jpeg`)
- Clean, professional naming

### 3. **Cleaned Up**
- ✅ Removed old placeholder image
- ✅ Kept only `bg2.jpg` (background) in public root
- ✅ All story images now organized in `/stories/` folder
